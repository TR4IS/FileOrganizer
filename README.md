## 📉 Performance

- My Specs:
  - i7-8700 3.20GHz
  - 32G RAM
  - Nivida RTX 4060ti
    
- Script Performance:
  - RAM Usage => 32.1 MB
  - Disk Usage (Idle) => 0 MB/S
  - Disk Usage (Working) => it depends on the content but usually not above 0.90 MB/s
 
The data presented are based on my specific use case and may vary from your own experience

## 📂 How It Works

The script:
1. Scans your `Downloads` folder.
2. Identifies each file’s extension.
3. Moves the file to its corresponding category folder.
4. Creates folders if they don’t exist.

## ⚠️ Disclaimer
  This app organizes your files by moving them to new folders.  
  If other programs are using those files, they may appear to "disappear" because their paths have changed.  
  Make sure to update any shortcuts or software that relies on the original file locations.
